This would be the last part in the Manipulating Data section.

  The first thing that we are going to see today if we want to shuffle the order of the dataset
  car_sales.sample(frac=0.5)
  this command means that take a sample of the car_sales dataset and shuffle it. The frac parameter means using a fraction of the datset. frac = 1 would mean using the whole dataset and here 0.5 means using half of that dataset.
  Don't forget to reassign the new shuffled dataset or it will be lost
