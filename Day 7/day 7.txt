This would be the last part of the Manipulating Data section.

  The first thing that we are going to see today is if we want to shuffle the order of the dataset
  car_sales.sample(frac=0.5)
  This command means taking a sample of the car_sales dataset and shuffling it. The frac parameter means using a fraction of the dataset. frac = 1 would mean using the whole dataset and here 0.5 means using half of that dataset.
  Don't forget to reassign the new shuffled dataset or it will be lost

What if you want to reset a shuffled list? We can do that as well using
car_sales_shuffled.reset_index(inplace = True, drop = True) this command.
Here the reset index function resets the dataset according to their indexes and the parameter in place means reassigning it and drop here means not adding any additional indexes 

The last thing we will learn is how we can apply custom functions to our dataset.
And to do that we can use the following command
Suppose we want to convert our Odometer KM column to be in miles so we would use the apply() function
car_sales["Odometer (KM)"] = car_sales["Odometer (KM)"].apply(lambda x : x / 1.6)

here we are applying lambda x: x/ 1.6 means applying this function or equation over the odometer KM column

lambda tells pandas that we are going to use a custom function
x here is the odometer Km
: means equal to
then x / 1.6 means Odometer KM divided by 1.6 
Because 1 mile is = 1.6 KM

Check out the notebook to get more details

and that wraps up our Pandas Section. Nex we will move to numpy
