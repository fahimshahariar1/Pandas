Day 1 of learning Pandas

  on Day 1 of learning Pandas, we are going to learn about the absolute basics of Pandas

  Pandas is a library that is used for data manipulation and analysis

  On Day 1 we learned about the Data types of Pandas and how we can import and export data

Pandas have two main datatypes
1. Series - this is Simply a one dimension array or list
2. Data frame = Data frame is a 2-dimensional list or array. We can create multiple Series and then add them together to make a DataFrame
(Check out the code file or Notebook attached for more details)


Importing Data
In order to import data to your notebook you need to use the command car_sales = pd.read_csv("car-sales.csv")
where the car_sales is a variable where we are storing the imported data. then calling a function of pandas library {pd.read_csv} and then passing on the file path or file name inside it.
You can use Tab to auto-complete the file name or path. You can either import it from any location of your PC or can just keep it in the project folder and then import it from there
(Check out the code file or Notebook attached for more details)


Exporting Data
Now to export the dataframe you can use the following command car_sales.to_csv("exported.csv", index = False)
we can also do .to_excel but csv is much better. This command would export the dataframe as the name is mentioned inside the string. and remember to put the index = False or the exported file will generate a random index numbers in the DataFrame

That's all for Day 1
