Day 2 of learning Pandas

  on day 2 we will learn how to import a file or data from a URL

  For example, the file we used on Day 1 is in the Resources section of this repo.
  To import that onto our notebook we can use the following command. 
car_data = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fahimshahariar1/Pandas/refs/heads/main/Resouces/car-sales.csv")

You need to click on the raw tab and then copy the link and paste it inside the read_csv() function
