On day 4 we are continuing the selecting and viewing part

  if we want to check columns in a more comparative way we can use the following command
  pd.crosstab(car_sales["Make"], car_sales["Doors"])
here we are asking pandas to give us a comparative description of just the make and doors column from the dataset

if we want to create a group in a dataset and perform any action we can use the groupby function
car_sales.groupby(["Make"]).mean(numeric_only = True)

if we want to plot our dataset we can use the plot function. that will give us an overview in a graph of our dataset
car_sales["Odometer (KM)"].plot()

we can also look into histogram of our dataset using car_sales["Odometer (KM)"].hist() command
