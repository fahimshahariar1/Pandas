On day 4 we are continuing the selecting and viewing part

  if we want to check columns in a more comparative way we can use the following command
  pd.crosstab(car_sales["Make"], car_sales["Doors"])
here we are asking pandas to give us a comparative description of just the make and doors column from the dataset
