On day 5 of learning Pandas, we will learn about how we can manipulate data.

We have seen ways to select and view different types of data in a dataset now we will try to manipulate those according to our needs

The first function that we will see today is the lower function that we can use to lowercase certain column using the following command 
car_sales["Make"].str.lower()

Next, we will see how to deal with missing values in pandas.
You can find the missing value file in the resource folder

Now suppose we want to fill in the missing values of the odometer column using the mean value of the odometer then we can use the following command
car_sales_missing["Odometer"].fillna(car_sales_missing["Odometer"].mean())

It will reassign it to the original missing values

If we want to drop or remove all the values that are missing we can use the dropna function
car_sales_missing.dropna(inplace = True)
this inplace parameter automatically reassigns the new values to the original data set showing a cleaner dataset to work on
