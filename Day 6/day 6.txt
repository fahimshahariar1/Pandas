On day 6 we continued the part of manipulating data

We have seen multiple ways of viewing selecting and replacing data but what if we want to create or add another data into our dataset like another column
Yes, we can do that as well. To add a column to our dataset we can use the following command
car_sales["Seats"] = seat_column
Check out the notebook for detailed work

Now what if you want to create a column from a python list?

We can do that as well
But here is an interesting catch
if we create from a python list like this fuel_economy = [7.6, 8.9, 9.0, 8.5, 3.0, 7.9, 5.5]
then you would notice that we are getting an error after running it. because we haven't provided all the values required according to the dataset. For example the dataset has 9 index and if we provide anything but less than that value this will cause an error.

Remember this wasn't the case when we created it from series. So  the final command would be
#Column from a Python List
fuel_economy = [7.6, 8.9, 9.0, 8.5, 3.0, 7.9, 5.5, 6.7, 9.9, 10]
car_sales["Fuel per 100KM"] = fuel_economy
